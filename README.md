## Issues

Any problems, no matter how small, should be added here ---> [https://github.com/kaylathedev/goodwillfire18-website/issues](Issues) <---

Examples:

 > When I click on the news page, I see is a blank screen for a few seconds, then it loads. Can we make it have a loading bar?

 > Click on "Certifications", scroll to the middle, and look at the red "Water Rescue" box. There's a gray space next to it. I don't think that should be there.
